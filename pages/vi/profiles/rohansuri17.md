### Hello everyone! My name is Rohan and I am a rising senior computer science student in Colorado. ###
I have previous experience with software development, full stack web development, and software engineering.
I am very interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and spend a lot of free time reading up 
on different AI/ML concepts. I am very well versed in software and am here to expand 
my skill-set even more to include working with Raspberry PI. 

<br>
My favorite colors are:<br> 
1. Red<br>
2. Blue<br>
3. Green<br>

```
std::string str = "hello friends";
std::cout<< str<<endl;
```

*Emphasizing how excited I am*
